\beginverse\memorize
\[Gm]Take me back to my boat on the river, I \[F]need to go down, I \[D7]need to calm down.
\[Gm]take me back to my boat on the river, and \[F]I won't cry out any\[Gm]more.
\[Gm]Time stands still as I gaze in her waters, 
she \[F]eases me down \[D7]touching me gently,
\[Gm]with the waters that flow past my boat on the river, so \[F]I won't cry out any\[Gm]more.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh the \[F]river is wide, the \[D7]river it touches my \[Gm]life like the waves on \[C]the sand.
And \[Cm]all roads lead to \[Gm]Tranquility Base, where the \[A]frown on my face disap\[D7]pears.
\[Gm]Take me back to my boat on the river, and \[F]I won't cry \[D7]out any\[Gm]more.
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Oh the \[F]river is deep, the \[D7]river it touches my \[Gm]life like the waves on the\[C] sand.
And \[C]all roads lead to \[Gm]Tranquility Base, where the \[A]frown on my face \[D7]disappears.
\[Gm]Take me down to my boat on the river, 
I \[F]need to go down, \[D7]would you let me go down?
\[Gm]Take me back to my boat on the river, and \[F]I won't cry out any\[Gm]more,
and \[F]I won't cry out any\[Gm]more, and \[D7]I won't cry out any\[Gm]more.
