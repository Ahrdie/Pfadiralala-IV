Cause it's \[C]easy once you \[Em]know how it's done, you \[D]can't stop now it's al\[Em]ready begun.

^Shut up, ^Hush your mouth, ^can't you hear you ^talk too loud. ^^^^
No I ^can't hear ^nothing cause I ^got my head up ^in the clouds. ^^^^
I ^bite off ^anything that ^I can ^chew,
I'm ^chasing cars ^up and down the ^ave^nue, but ^that's ok... ^^^
