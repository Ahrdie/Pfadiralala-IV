\beginverse
I was \[Am]sitting in a station bar,
\[C]somewhere in \[G]america\[Am]
when an \[C]old man came to \[G]me  
he \[Am]said: "can I sit next to you?",  
and \[C]I had nothing \[G]else to do\[Am]
so he sat \[C]down and drank his \[G]beer 
\endverse

\beginverse
he ^told me 'bout the rocks and hills,
a^bout the autumn ^and its chill^
about the ^valleys and the ^rain
and ^then he spoke of former times,
a^bout his children ^and his wife^
and a^bout what yet re^mained  
\endverse

\beginverse*
\[F]suddenly he \[G]said: "my son,
\[F]do you know the \[Em]land,
\[Em]where \[Em]i've \[Em]come \[Em]from
\[Em]and \[Em]he \[Em]asked
\endverse

\beginchorus
\lrep\[Am]do you know the \[G]land of green,
\[Em] its rough an\[F]d stormy \[G]sea
\[Am]do you know the \[G]island of the \[Em]rain\[F]\[G]\rrep
\endchorus

\beginverse
^many of us had left their homes,
^never felt the ^westwind blow a^gain
he ^said with lonely ^eyes
they ^once had worked upon the land,
that ^now is in some ^stranger's hands^
he ^said with angry ^eyes
\endverse

\beginverse*
the \[F]more he spoke, the \[G]more he drank
\[F]the more he kept
on \[Em]telling \[Em]'bout \[Em]his \[Em]land
\[Em]and \[Em]he \[Em]said 
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
even ^though the bar was full of noise,
the ^man began to ^lower his voice^
and stood ^up without a ^word
al^though it is five years ago
I ^swear that I ex^actly know^
every ^word that we had ^said
\endverse

\beginverse*
I \[F]still can see \[G]his trembling hands,
\[F]as he told the \[Em]story \[Em]'bout \[Em]his \[Em]land
\[Em]and h\[Em]e \[Em]said 
\endverse

\repchorus{2}

\beginverse*
The \[F]Land \[G]of \[A]Greeeeeeeen!
