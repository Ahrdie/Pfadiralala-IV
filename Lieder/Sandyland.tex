%\[C]Don't build your house on the sandy land, 
%Don't build it too near the \[G7]shore.
%Well, it \[C]might look kind of \[C7]nice,
%But you'll \[F]have to build it twice,
%Yes, you'll \[C]have to build your \[G7]house once \[C]more.
%You'd better \[C]build your house upon the rock,
%Make a \[C]good foundation on the \[G7]solid rock
%And the \[C]storms \[C7]may \[F]come and go, 
%But the \[C]peace of God \[G7]you will \[C]know.
