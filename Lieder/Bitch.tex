I \[A]hate the world today \[E] \[D]
you're so good to me I \[A]know but I can't change \[E] \[D] 
try to tell you but you \[F#m]look at me like maybe 
I'm an \[Hm]angel underneath \[D]innocent and sweet
\endverse

\beginverse
^Yesterday I cried ^ ^
you must have been relieved to ^see the softer side ^ ^
I can understand how ^you'd be so confused ^I don't envy you
I'm a ^little bit of everything all rolled into one
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm a \[A]bitch I'm a lover I'm a \[E]child I'm a mother
I'm a \[Hm]sinner I'm a saint I \[D]do not feel ashamed
I'm your \[A]hell I'm your dream I'm \[E]nothing in between
you know you \[F#m]wouldn't want it any other \[D]way
\endchorus


\beginverse
So ^take me as I am ^ ^
this may mean you'll have to ^be a stronger man ^ ^
rest assured that when I ^start to make you nervous
and I'm ^going to extremes ^tomorrow I would change
and today won't mean a thing

\[E]I think it's cool
you \[F#m]do what you do and \[D]don't try to save me
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm a \[A]bitch I'm a tease I'm a \[E]goddess on my knees
when you \[Hm]hurt when you suffer I'm your \[D]angel undercover
