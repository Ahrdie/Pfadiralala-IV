{\nolyrics Intro: \[Hm] \[G] \[A]}

A hundred \[Hm]days have made me older,
since the \[A]last time that I saw your pretty face. \[Hm] \[G] \[A]
A thousand \[Hm]lies have made me colder
and I \[A]don't think I can look at this the same. \[Hm] \[G] \[A]
\[Hm] But all the miles that sepe\[A]rate,
\[Hm] they disappear now, when I'm \[G]dreaming of your \[A]face.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D] I'm here without you, baby. \[A]
But you're still on my lonely \[Hm]mind.
I think about you, baby, \[G]and I dream a\[A]bout you all the \[D]time.
I'm here without you, baby. \[A]
But you're still with me in my \[Hm]dreams.
And to\[G]night, there's \[A]only you and \[Hm]me, \[A]yeah. 
\endchorus

\beginverse
{\nolyrics Zwischenspiel: ^ ^ ^}
The ^miles just keep rollin',
as the ^people leave their way to say hello. ^ ^ ^
I've heard this ^life is overrated,
but I ^hope that it gets better as we ^go, ^ohh ^yeah.

\[Hm] Everything I know, \[D] and everywhere I go,
\[A] it gets hard but it won't \[G]take away my love.

\[A] it gets hard, but it won't \[G]take away my love, whoa, \[D]oh,\[A] oh \[Hm]yeah. \[G] \[A]
