\beginverse\memorize
\[Hm]I took a walk around the \[G]world to ease my \[Asus2]troubled mind, \[Hm]
I left my body lying \[G]somewhere in the \[Asus2]sands of time, \[Hm]
but I watched the world float to the \[G]dark side of the \[Asus2]moon, \[Hm]
I feel there's nothing I can \[G]do,\[Asus2] \[Hm]yeah.
\endverse

\beginverse
^I watched the world float to the ^dark side of the ^moon. ^
After all I knew it had to ^be something to ^do with you. ^
I really don't mind what ^happens now and ^then, 
as ^long as you'll be my ^friend at the ^end.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Hm]If I go crazy then will \[G]you still call me \[Asus2]superman.
\[Hm]If I'm alive and well will \[G]you be there a-\[Asus2]holding my \[Hm]hand,
I'll keep you by my side with \[G]my super hu\[Asus2]man migh\[Hm]t, Kryptonite. \[G] \[Asus2]
\endchorus

\beginverse
^You call me strong, you call me ^weak, but still your ^secrets I will ^keep, 
you took for granted all the ^times I never ^let you down.  ^
You stumble again and bump your ^head, if not for ^me then you'd be ^dead. 
I picked you up and put you ^back on solid ^ground.
\endverse
