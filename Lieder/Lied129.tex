\beginverse
\[Em]No one knows what it's \[G6]like to be the \[Dsus2]bad man,
To be the \[Cadd9]sad man, be\[Asus2]hind blue eyes.
And \[Em]no one knows what it's \[G6]like to be \[Dsus2]hated,
to be \[Cadd9]faded to telling \[Asus2]only lies.
\endverse

\beginchorus
But my \[Cadd9]dre\[D]ams they aren't as \[G]empty,
as my \[Cadd9]conscience \[D]seems to \[E]be. \[Esus4] \[E] \[Esus4] \[E]
I have \[Hm]hours, only \[Cadd9]lonely
My love is \[D]vengeance, that's never \[Asus2]free.
\endchorus

\beginverse
^No one knows what it's ^like to feel these ^feelings,
like I ^do, and I blame ^you!

^No one bites back as ^hard on their ^anger,
none of my ^pain woe can show ^through.
