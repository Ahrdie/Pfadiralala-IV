\beginsong{Far Far Away}[wuw={Slade}, jahr={1974}, alb={Slade in Flame}, pfiii={196}, index={I've seen the yellow lights}]

\beginverse\memorize
I've seen the \[Hm]yellow lights go \[A]down the Missis\[Hm]sippi, \[A]
I've seen the \[Hm]bridges of the \[A]world and they are for \[Hm]real,
I've had a \[G]red light off-the-\[A]wirst without me \[D]even getting kissed,
It \[G]still seems so un\[A]real
\endverse

\beginverse
I've seen the ^morning in the ^mountains of Al^aska, ^
I've seen the ^sunset in the ^East and in the ^West,
I've sang the ^glory that was ^Rome,
and passed the ^''Hound Dog''-singer's home,
It ^still seems for the ^best.
\endverse

\beginchorus
And I'm \[D]far, \[D/c#]far a\[D/h]way, \[D/a]
with my \[G]head up in the \[A]clouds.
And I'm \[D]far, \[D/c#]far a\[D/h]way, \[D/a]
with my \[G]feet down in the \[A]crowds.
Letting \[D]loose a\[D/c#]round the \[D/h]world, \[D/a]
but the \[G]call of home is \[F#]loud,
still as \[Hm]loud. \[A] \[Hm] \[A] \[Hm] \[A]
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've seen the ^yellow lights go ^down the Missis^sippi, ^
the Grand Ba^hama Island ^stories carry ^on.
And though those ^aligator ^smiles,
stay in your ^memory for a while,
there ^still seems more to ^come.
\endverse
