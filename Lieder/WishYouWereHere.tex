\beginverse\memorize
\[C]So, so you think you can \[D]tell
Heaven from \[Am]hell, blue skies from \[G]pain.
Can you tell a green \[D]field from a cold steel \[C]rail?
A smile from a \[Am]veil? Do you think you can \[G]tell?	
\endverse

\beginverse
And did they get you to \[C]trade
your heroes for gh\[D]osts? Hot ashes for \[Am]trees?
Hot air for a \[G]cool breeze? Cold comfort for \[D]change?
And did you ex\[C]change a walk on part in a \[Am]war
for a lead role in ca\[G]ge?

\beginchorus
\[C]How I wish, how I wish you were \[D]here.
We're just \[Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, \[G]year after year.
\[D]Running over the same old grounds, \[C]what have we found?
The same old f\[Am]ears, wish you were h\[G]ere.
