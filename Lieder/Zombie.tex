\[Em]Another h\[C]ead hangs lowly c\[G]hild is slowly ta\[D/f#]ken
\[Em]And the violence c\[C]aused such silence w\[G]ho are we mistak\[D/f#]en
But you s\[Em]ee it's not me, it's not m\[C]y family, in your h\[G]ead, in your head they are figh\[D/f#]ting
With their t\[Em]anks and their bombs, and their b\[C]ombs and their guns, in your h\[G]ead, in your head they are cryin\[D/f#]'

\beginverse
^Another mo^ther's breakin' he^art is taking o^ver
^When the violence c^auses silence, ^we must be mis^taken.
It's the s^ame old theme since ^1916, in your h^ead, in your head, they're still f^ightin'
With their t^anks and their bombs en' their bombs en' their g^uns, in your h^ead, in your head, they're d^ying.
