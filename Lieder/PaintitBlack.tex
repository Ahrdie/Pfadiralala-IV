\beginverse
^I see a line of cars and ^they're all painted black,
^With flowers and my love both ^never to come back.
^I ^see people ^turn their ^heads and ^quickly look away.
^Like a ^new born ^baby ^it just ^happens every ^day.
\endverse

\beginverse
^I look inside myself and ^see my heart is black.
^I see my red door and I ^want it painted black.
^Maybe ^then I'll ^fade a^way and ^not have to face the facts. 
^It's not ^easy ^facing ^up when ^your whole world is ^black.
\endverse

\beginverse
^No more will my green sea go ^turn a deeper blue,
^I could not foresee this thing ^happening to you.
^If ^I look ^hard e^nought in^to the setting sun,
^my ^love will ^laugh with ^me be^fore the morning ^comes.
