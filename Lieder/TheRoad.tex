\beginverse\memorize
\[Hm]Headlights, white lines, black tar rivers,
\[Em]dragging me \[G]around this \[D]country as it \[Em]withers.
The \[Hm]billboards, signposts, standing in the way,
\[Em]tell of the state of the \[G]nations, \[D]that we find \[Em]today.
\endverse

\beginchorus
And we'll \[G]play and we'll \[D]play and we'll \[C]play,
to every \[G]day, every \[D]day every \[C]day... to every \[G]day.

\beginverse
In the ^front rooms of old towns far from the city,
with ^beaten up ^guitars and ^hearts full of ^pity.
The ^people gather round singing songs from everywhere,
^torn from the ^nation, ^left without a ^care.

\beginchorus
And we'll \[Em]rid the bloody \[D]world for a \[C]moment in a \[G]word
Yes we'll \[Em]rid the bloody \[D]world, because...
\lrep The \[C]words that you heard when you were \[G]young will always stay,
the \[D]one's that always stay make the \[C]world go away \rrep ~~...go a\[G]way!

\beginverse
^Warm night, clear sky, European town,
out^side the ^bars singing their ^hearts out to a ^crowd.
^Open boots, violin, banjo and a voice,
^exiled ^buskers, ^happy with their ^choice.
