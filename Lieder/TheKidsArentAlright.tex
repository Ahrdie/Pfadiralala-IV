\beginverse\memorize
\[Am] When we were young the future was so bright, \echo{wh\[F]oa}
the old neighborhood was so alive, \echo{wh\[C]oa}
and every kid on the whole damn street, \echo{wh\[G]oa}
was gonna make it big and not be beat.
~\\
^ Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn, \echo{wh^oa}
the kids are grown up, but their lives are worn. \echo{wh^oa}
How can one little street ^swallow so many lives?
\endverse

\beginchorus
Chances ^thrown, nothing's ^free,
longing ^for, what used to ^be.
Still it's ^hard, hard to ^see,
fragile ^lives, shattered ^dreams. \echo{Go!}
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ Jamie had a chance, well she really did, \echo{wh^oa}
instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids. \echo{wh^oa}
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job, \echo{wh^oa}
just plays guitar, smokes a lot of pot.
% ~\\
\newpage
^Jay committed suicide \echo{wh^oa}
- Brandon OD'd and died \echo{wh^oa}
What the hell is going on, ^cruelest dreams, reality!
\endverse

\beginchorus
Chances ^thrown, nothing's ^free,
longing ^for, what used to ^be.
Still it's ^hard, hard to ^see,
fragile ^lives, shattered ^dreams. \echo{Go!}
