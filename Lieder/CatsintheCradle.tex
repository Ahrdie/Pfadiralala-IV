\beginverse
My \[E]child arrived just the \[G]other day,
he \[A]came to the world in the \[E]usual way,
but there were \[E]planes to catch and \[G]bills to pay,
he \[A]learned to walk while I \[E]was away.

He was \[D]talking 'fore I knew it and when he could, 
he said \[G]I'm gonna be like you, \[E]dad,
you \[G]know I'm gonna be like \[E]you.
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the \[E]cats in the cradle and the \[G]silver spoon,
\[G]little boy blue and the \[A]man on the moon.
\[E]'When you're commin' home son?' - 'I \[D]don't know when,
\[G]but we'll get together \[E]then,
you \[G]know we'll have a good time \[E]then!'
\endchorus

\beginverse
My ^son turned ten just the ^other day,
he said ^'Thanks for the ball dad, come ^on, let's play.
Could you ^teach me to throw?', I said ^'Not today
I got a ^lot to do', he said ^'That's OK.'

He ^walked away with a smile on his face, 
he ^said 'I'm gonna be like ^him, yeah,
you ^know I'm gonna be like ^him!'
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
Well he ^came from college just the ^other day,
so ^much like a man I just ^had to say:
'Son, I'm ^proud of you, could you ^sit for a while?'
He ^shook his head and he ^said with a smile:

'What I'd ^really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys,
^see you later, can I ^have them please?'
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
I've ^long since retired, my ^son's moved away,
I ^called him up just the ^other day.
'I'd ^like to see you, if ^you don't mind.',
he said: 'I'd ^love to, dad, if I could ^find the time.

You see, my ^new job's hassle and the kids got the flu,
but it's ^sure nice talking to ^you dad, 
it was ^sure nice talking to you.' \[E]

And as I \[D]hung up the phone it occurred to me:
He'd \[G]grown up just like \[E]me,
my \[G]boy was just like \[E]me!
