How long \[D]will we \[G]talk? How \[A]long will we \[Hm]prod?
How \[G]long must we fret and \[A]hoard?
How long \[D]will we \[G]walk to \[A]tear down this fa\[Hm]cade?
How \[G]long? How \[Asus4]long, o \[D]Lord?
\endverse

\beginchorus
Until \[G]all are fed we \[D]cry out, 
until \[G]all on earth have \[A]bread.
Like the \[D]One who \[G]loves us \[Hm]each and every \[G]one, 
we \[Em7]serve until \[Asus4]all \[A]are \[D]fed.
\endchorus

\beginverse
How can ^we stand ^by and ^fail to be a^ghast?
How ^long 'til we do what's ^right?
How could ^we stand ^by and ^choose a lesser ^fast?
How ^long 'til we ^see the ^light?
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
On the ^green, green ^grass they ^gathered long ^ago
to ^hear what the Master ^said.
What they ^had they ^shared, some ^fishes and some ^loaves,
they ^served until ^all were ^fed.
