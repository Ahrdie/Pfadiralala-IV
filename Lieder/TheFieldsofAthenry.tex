\beginverse\memorize
By a \[G]lonely prison wall I \[C]heard a young man \[G]cal\[D]ling:
''\[G]Nothin matters \[C]Mary when you're \[D]free,
against the \[G]famine and the \[C]crown I re\[G]belled they cut me \[D]down,
now you must raise our \[D7]child with digni\[G]ty.''
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Low \[C]lie the \[G]Fields of Athen\[Em]ry,
where \[G]once we watched the small free birds \[D]fly. 
Our \[G]love was on the \[C]wing. We had \[G]dreams and songs to \[D]sing.
Now it's so lonely 'round the \[D7]fields of Athen\[G]ry. 
\endchorus

\beginverse
By ^a lonely harbour wall, she ^watched the last star ^fal^ling ,
as the ^prison ship sailed ^out against the ^sky.
For she ^lived to hope and ^pray for her ^love in botany ^bay
and it's lonely round the ^fields of Athen^ry.
