\beginsong{The Fields of Athenry}[wuw={Pete St. Johan}, index={By a lonely prison wall}]

\beginverse\memorize
By a \[G]lonely prison wall I \[C]heard a young girl \[G]call\[D]ing:
''\[G]Michael they are \[C]taking you a\[D]way for you \[G]stole
Trevelyan's \[C]corn so the \[G]young migth see the \[D]morn.
Now a prison ship lies \[D7]waiting in the \[G]bay.''
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Low \[C]lie the \[G]Fields of Athen\[Em]ry,
where \[G]once we watched the small free birds \[D]fly. 
Our \[G]love was on the \[C]wing. We had \[G]dreams and songs to \[D]sing.
Now it's so loney 'round the \[D7]fields of Athen\[G]ry. 
\endchorus

\beginverse
By a ^lonely prison wall I ^heard a young man ^cal^ling:
''^Nothin matters ^Mary when you're ^free. 
Against the ^famine and the ^crown I re^belled they cut me ^down.
Now you must raise our ^child with digni^ty.''
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
By ^a lonely harbour wall, she ^watched the last star ^fal^ling 
as the ^prison ship sailed ^out against the ^sky.
For she ^lived to hope and ^pray for her ^love in botany ^bay
and it's lonely round the ^fields of Athen^ry.
