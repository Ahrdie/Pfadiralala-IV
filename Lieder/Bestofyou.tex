\beginverse
I've got another con\[C#m]fession to make, 
I'm your \[A]fool.
Everyone's got their \[C#m]chains to break,               
holdin' \[A]you.          
Were you born to re\[H]sist or be ab\[A]used?  
\endverse
 
\beginchorus        
Is someone getting the \[C#m]best, the best, the \[H]best, the best of \[A]you?                      
Is someone getting the \[C#m]best, the best, the \[H]best, the best of \[A]you?         
\[C#m]Are you gone and \[H]onto someone \[A]new?
\endchorus

\beginverse
I needed somewhere to ^hang my head            
without your ^noose.           
You gave me something that I ^didn't have,
but had no ^use.
I was too weak to give ^in, too strong to ^lose.
\endverse

\beginverse
My heart is under ^arrest again,
but I break ^loose.             
My head is giving me ^life or death,
but I can't ^choose.
I swear I'll never give \[H]in, I re\[A]fuse.
\endverse

Is someone getting the \[C#m]best, the best, the \[H]best, the best of \[A]you?    
Has someone taken your \[C#m]faith?  
Its real, the \[H]pain you feel

Has someone taken your \[C#m]faith?
Its real, the \[H]pain you feel.
The \[A]life, the love, you'd \[F#m]die to heal.
The \[C#m]hope that starts, the \[H]broken hearts.
You \[A]trust, you must, con\[F#m]fess.
Is someone getting the \[C#m]best, the best, the \[H]best, the best of \[A]you?

I've got another con\[C#m]fession my friend,
I'm no \[A]fool.
