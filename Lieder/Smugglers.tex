\beginverse
% The \[C]boat rides south of \[G]Ailsa \[C]Craig in the \[F]waning \[C]of the \[G]light.
% There's \[F]thirty \[G]men in \[C]Lendal \[Am]fit to \[F]make our \[C]burden \[G]light.
% And there's \[C]thirty horse in \[G]Hazle\[C]holm with the \[F]halters \[C]on their \[G]heads.
% All \[F]set this \[G]night up \[C]on your \[Am]life if \[F]wind and \[Dm]water \[C]speed.

\beginverse\memorize
''Oh \[C]lass you have a \[G]cozy \[C]bed, and \[F]cattle \[C]you have \[G]ten. 
Can \[F]you not \[G]live a \[C]lawful \[Am]life and \[F]live with \[C]lawful \[G]men?'' 
But \[C]must I use old \[G]homely \[C]goods while there's \[F]foreign \[C]gear so \[G]fine?  
Must \[F]I drink \[G]at the \[C]water\[Am]side and \[F]France so \[Dm]full of \[C]wine.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Am]Smugglers drink of the \[Em]frenchmens wine 
and the \[Am]darkest night is the \[C]smugglers \[G]time. 
A\[F]way we ran from the \[C]excise\[Am]man. 
It's a \[C]smugglers life for \[F]me. It's a \[C]smugglers \[G7]life for \[C]me.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Though ^well I like to ^see you ^Kate, with a ^baby ^on your ^knee. 
My ^heart is ^now with the ^gallant ^crew that ^plough through the ^angry ^sea. 
The ^bitter gale, the ^tightest ^sail, and the ^sheltered ^bay or ^goal. 
It's the ^wayward ^life, it's the ^smugglers ^strife, it's the ^joy of the ^smugglers ^soul.
\endverse

\printchorus

\beginverse
And ^when at last the ^dawn comes ^up and the ^cargoâ€™s ^safely ^stored,
like ^sinless ^saints to ^church we'll ^go, God's ^mercy ^to af^ford.
And it's ^champagne fine for ^communion ^wine and the ^parson ^drinks it, ^too.
With a ^sly wink ^prays ''For^give these ^men, for they ^know not ^what they ^do.''
