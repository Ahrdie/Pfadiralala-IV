\beginchorus
^All the other kids with the ^pumped up kicks,
you'd better ^run, better run, ^outrun my gun.
^All the other kids with the ^pumped up kicks,
you'd better ^run, better run, ^faster than my bullet.

\beginverse
^Daddy works a long day, ^
he'll be ^coming home late, he's ^coming home late.
And he's ^bringing me a surprise, ^
'cause ^dinner's in the kitchen and it's ^packed in ice.
I've ^waited for a long time, ^\newpage
the ^slight of my hand is now a ^quick pull trigger.
I ^reason with my cigarette, ^
and say your ^hair's on fire, you must have ^lost your wits, yeah...
