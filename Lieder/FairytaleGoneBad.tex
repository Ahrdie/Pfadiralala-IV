\beginverse
This is the \[Am]end, you \[F]know, \[C]lady, the plans we had went all wrong,
\[G]we ain't nothing but \[Dm]fight and shout and \[Am]tears.

We got to a \[Am]point, I can't \[F]stand, I've \[C]had it to the limit, I can't be your man,
\[G]I ain't more than a \[Dm]minute away from \[Am]walking.
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[F] We can't \[C]cry the \[G]pain a\[F]way, we can't \[C]find a \[G]need to \[F]stay,
I slowly \[C]rea\[G]lize there's \[F]nothing on our \[G]side.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Am]Out of my life, out of my \[F]mind, out of the tears, we can't de\[G]ny, 
we need to \[Am]swallow all our \[F]pride and leave this mess be\[G]hind.

\[Am]Out of my head, out of my \[F]bed, out of the dreams we had, they're \[G]bad,
tell them it's \[Am]me who made you \[F]sad, tell them the fairy\[G]tale gone bad.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Another ^night and I ^bleed, they ^all make mistakes and so did we,
but ^we did something we can ^never turn back ^right.

Find a new ^one to ^fool, ^leave and don't look back, I won't follow,
^we have nothing left, ^it's the end of ^our time.
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[F] We can't \[C]cry the \[G]pain a\[F]way, we can't \[C]find a \[G]need to \[F]stay,
there's no more \[C]rabbits \[G]in my \[F]hat to make things \[G]right.
