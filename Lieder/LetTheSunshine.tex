\beginsong{Let the Sunshine in}[wuw={The 5th Dimension}, jahr={1969}]

\beginverse\memorize
We \[Am]starve-look, at one another, short of breath, 
walking proudly in our winter \[G]coats,
wearing smells from laboratories, 
\[Am]facing a dying \[C]nation of \[Am]moving paper \[E]fantasy, 
\[E7]listening for the new told \[Am]lies with sur\[F]preme visions of \[C]lonely tunes.
\endverse

\beginverse
^Somewhere, inside something there is a rush of
greatness. Who knows what stands in ^front of
our lives? I fashion my 
^future on ^films in space. ^Silence tells me ^secretly
^every^thing, ^every^thing.
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]Manchester, England, England.
Manchester, England, England,  \hfill\echo{Eyes look your last.}
across the Atlantic Sea\hfill\echo{Arms take your last embrace,}
And \[Dm]I'm a genius genius, \hfill\echo{and \[(Dm)]lips, oh you the doors}
I be\[E]lieve in God, and I \hfill\echo{of \[(E)]breath. Seal with a righteous kiss.}
believe that God believes in Claude. That's me, \hfill\echo{Seal with a righteous kiss.}
\[Am] that's me, that's me. \hfill\echo{The rest is \[(Am)]silence, the rest is silence}

^Singing our space songs on a spider web sitar.
Life is around you and ^in you,
