\beginverse
I sit and \[E]wait, does \[Esus]an \[E]angel contemp\[A]late my fate? \[C#m] \[H]
And do they know\[E] the places where we go when we're grey and \[A]old? \[C#m] \[H]
`Cause I have been \[A]told that salvation let`s their \[C#m]wings unfold. \[A]\\
~\\
So when I'm \[D]lying in my bed, thoughts \[A]running through my head,
and I \[E]feel the love is dead...
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D] I'm loving \[A]angels in\[E]stead.
And through it \[H]all she offers me pro\[C#m]tection
A lot of love and af\[A]fection, whether I'm right or \[E]wrong.
And down the water\[H]fall, wherever it may \[C#m]take me,
I know that life won't \[A]break me, when I come to \[G#m]call,
she won't for\[F#m]sake me,\[D] I'm loving \[A]angels in\[E]stead.
\endchorus

\beginverse
^ When I'm feeling weak, and ^^{my pain} walks down a ^one way street. ^ ^
I look above^, and I know I'll always be ^blessed with love. ^ ^\\
~\\
And ^as the feeling grows, she breathes ^flesh to my bones,
and ^when love is dead...
